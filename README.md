## Features
Click Counter: A large, satisfying button to increment the count.

Custom Targets: Users can set a specific click target to aim for.

Automatic Timer: As soon as the first click is made towards a target, a timer starts, measuring the time taken to reach the goal.

Best Time Tracking: The app keeps track of and displays the user's best time for the current target session.

Visual Progress Bar: A dynamic progress bar at the bottom provides a visual representation of how close the user is to their target.

Confetti Celebration: A fun confetti explosion celebrates the moment the user reaches their target.

Responsive Design: The layout seamlessly transitions from a single-column mobile view to a two-column desktop view for an optimal experience on any device.

Self-Contained Component: All logic, styling, and sub-components are encapsulated within a single, easy-to-use App.jsx file.

Tech Stack
React: The core of the application is built using React, leveraging functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo).

CSS-in-JS: All styling is handled directly within the component using a <style> tag. It uses modern CSS features like CSS variables for theming, Flexbox, and Grid for layout, and keyframe animations for effects.

JavaScript (ES6+): The application logic is written in modern JavaScript.
